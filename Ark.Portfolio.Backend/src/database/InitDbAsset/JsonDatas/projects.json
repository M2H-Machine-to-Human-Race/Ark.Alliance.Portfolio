                "content": "### Philosophy: Chaos as Potential\n\nThe **Ark.Alliance** strategy is built on a simple premise: *You cannot predict the ocean, but you can learn to surf.* \n\nInstead of trying to forecast price 10 minutes from now, the bot reacts to *micro-movements* in the present moment. We call this **'Click Strategy'**.\n\n#### The 'Click' Mechanism\n\n1.  **Entry (The Paddle)**: The bot enters a position based on **Gemini AI Analysis** of order book imbalance and volatility.\n2.  **Surfing (The Ride)**: As price moves in favor, the bot executes 'Clicks'—partial take-profits at fixed intervals (e.g., every +0.1% PnL).\n    *   **Ratchet Effect**: Each click raises the 'Inversion Threshold' (Stop Loss), locking in gains.\n3.  **Inversion (The Bail)**: If the wave breaks (price reverses), the bot hits the 'Inversion Threshold'.\n    *   It instantly closes the position and flips to the opposite side (2x quantity).\n    *   **Result**: The surfer catches the *new* wave immediately.\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Entry\n    Entry --> Surfing: Price Moves Up\n    Surfing --> Click: +0.1% Gain\n    Click --> Surfing: Raise Safety Net\n    Surfing --> Inversion: Hit Safety Net\n    Inversion --> [*]: Flip Position\n```"

                "content": "### Speed vs. Reliability\n\nCrypto markets are 24/7 and unforgiving. The bot's architecture prioritizes **Resilience** over raw speed, though it achieves both.\n\n#### 1. Hybrid Push/Pull Architecture\n\nReliance on WebSockets alone is dangerous (silent disconnects). Reliability on Polling alone is too slow. We use **Both**.\n\n*   **Fast Path (Push)**: `BinanceUserDataStream` delivers order updates in ~50ms.\n*   **Safe Path (Pull)**: A `MonitoringLayout` polls the API every 200ms. If the WebSocket misses an event, the Poller catches it.\n\n#### 2. Fee Management & Pre-Computation\n\nTrading frequently ('Clicking') accumulates fees. Ignorance of fees leads to 'Death by a Thousand Cuts'.\n\n*   **Maker vs Taker**: The bot prefers `POST_ONLY` (Maker) orders to gain rebates.\n*   **Pre-Computation**: Before placing *any* trade, the `FuturesCost Service` calculates:\n    *   `OpenFee` + `CloseFee` + `FundingCost`\n    *   **Rule**: The first 'Click' target is moved *further out* to cover these costs. You are never 'Green' until the fees are paid.\n\n#### 3. Rate Limit Arbitrage\n\nBinance allows 1200 weight/minute. \n*   The **RateLimiter** service tracks usage in real-time.\n*   If usage > 80%, it switches non-critical polls to 'Lazy Mode', saving bandwidth for critical 'Inversion' orders.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Bot\n    participant RateLimiter\n    participant Binance\n\n    Bot->>RateLimiter: Can I Order?\n    RateLimiter->>RateLimiter: Check Weight (1100/1200)\n    alt Critical (Inversion)\n        RateLimiter-->>Bot: YES (Emergency Override)\n    else Standard (Poll)\n        RateLimiter-->>Bot: PAUSE (Save for Trade)\n    end\n    Bot->>Binance: Execute Order\n```"
